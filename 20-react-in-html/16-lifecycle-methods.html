             * Lifecycle phases of a insatnce of a component
             * 1. Mounting - the components instance comes into the page
             * 2. Update - there is state / props change
             * 3. Unmounting - before it goes off the page
             * 
             * We want to do something in these phases
             * 1. Mounting - we want to fetch teams as soon as TeamPage component loads on the page (when we go to /teams route)
             * 2. Update - we want to remove team / add a member and refresh the UI
             * 3. Unmounting - nothing to do in Team page
             * 
             * Specially named methods (they are executed at different phases)
             * 1. componentDidMount() - Mounting phase
             * 2. componentDidUpdate() - Update phase - after a state / prop change
             * 3. componentWillUnmount() - before the component is removed from the page (form example this is called on TeamsPage component instance when we move from /teams -> /meetings)
